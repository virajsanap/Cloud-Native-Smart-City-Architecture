This project presents a cloud-native architecture blueprint for a modern Smart City infrastructure. It explores how core smart-city systems—such as IoT sensing, data pipelines, real-time analytics, and citizen services—can leverage cloud computing to achieve scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. The report evaluates major cloud providers, justifies key design decisions, and proposes an end-to-end infrastructure and software architecture tailored for smart-city operations. The project emphasizes motivation, comparative analysis, architectural reasoning, and the practical role of cloud technologies in enabling intelligent urban environments.
